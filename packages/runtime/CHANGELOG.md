# @sfysh/runtime

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 46159c6: Parameterise `WorkflowFn`, `workflow()`, and `getWorkflow()` by context type (`TCtx = Page`). Defaults preserve existing browser-only behaviour; the generic parameter leaves the door open for future surfaces to register workflows against a different context shape without a signature break.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- a358a3a: Launch polish. The `0.1.0` tarballs were published before each `package.json` carried its full metadata; `0.1.1` fixes the npm registry pages. Every published package now ships with `description`, `keywords`, `license`, `homepage`, `bugs`, `author`, `engines`, and a `prepublishOnly` guard that rebuilds `dist/` before publish. No code changes to the runtime, compiler, IR, or adapter. The release workflow has also moved from `NPM_TOKEN` to npm Trusted Publishing (OIDC) with build provenance; `0.1.1` is the first release attempting the OIDC path.
